# AI-Assisted Information Consolidation Workflow

This document outlines an effective workflow for consolidating information from multiple source files into a single, comprehensive document using an AI assistant.

## Core Principles

The success of this workflow hinges on two core principles:

1.  **Iterative, Single-File Processing:** Instead of attempting to process all files at once, the AI should be instructed to handle one file at a time. This ensures that the context for each file is properly understood and reduces the risk of errors or missed information.
2.  **Structured Task Management:** A clear TODO list or plan should be established at the outset and meticulously followed. This provides a clear roadmap for both the user and the AI, ensuring that all tasks are completed in a logical order.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Initial Scoping and Planning:**
    *   The user provides the AI with the overall goal (e.g., "consolidate all information from this directory into this main report").
    *   The AI lists the files to be processed and creates a high-level plan or TODO list.
    *   The user reviews and approves the plan.

2.  **Iterative File Processing:**
    *   The AI processes one file at a time, as per the agreed-upon plan.
    *   For each file, the AI reads the content and identifies the key information to be integrated into the main report.
    *   The AI proposes the specific changes to be made to the main report (e.g., new sections to be added, existing sections to be updated).
    *   The user reviews and approves the changes.

3.  **File Cleanup:**
    *   Once a file has been processed and its information integrated into the main report, the AI moves the file to a designated "done" or "processed" directory. This keeps the workspace clean and prevents accidental re-processing of the same file.

4.  **Final Review:**
    *   After all files have been processed, the user and the AI perform a final review of the consolidated report to ensure that all information has been accurately and completely integrated.

## Key Takeaways

-   **One-by-one is better than all-at-once:** The AI is more effective when it can focus on a single file at a time.
-   **A clear plan is essential:** A TODO list ensures that both the user and the AI are on the same page and that no steps are missed.
-   **User supervision is crucial:** The user's role in reviewing and approving the AI's proposed changes is critical for ensuring the quality and accuracy of the final output.
